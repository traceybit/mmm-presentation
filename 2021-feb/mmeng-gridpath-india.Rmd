# Research questions

<hr/>

# We are interested in the following research questions:

1. How do renewable energy scenarios India look like given different technology costs, transmission constraints, and renewable portfolio standards (RPS)?

2. Will the environmental benefits of high renewable penetration be distributed equitably across India? 

3. How will the water usage for power plant operations change, and how will water constraints affect power plant operations?

.center[**Capacity expansion**]
* Examine how the generation mix should evolve over the long-term
* Decide whether to build or retire generation, storage, transmission

.center[**Production cost**]
* Simulate detailed operations of a power system over a short period
* Estimate operating costs of the system and assess impacts of investments or strategies on system operation
<!-- * Unit commitment and economic dispatch model solved over 1 day or 1 year at 5, 15 min or hourly temporal resolution. -->

# Addressing research question 1

.left-column[
How do renewable energy scenarios India look like given different technology costs, transmission constraints, and renewable portfolio standards (RPS)?
]

--
.right-column[
.center[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/india-grid.png")
```
]
For next steps, we will be adding the following to the India model:
* Multiple cost trajectories for wind, solar, and battery storage
* Transmission constraints
* Renewable portfolio obligations
]

# Addressing research question 2

.left-column[
Will the environmental benefits of high renewable penetration be distributed equitably across India? 
]

--
.right-column[
.center[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/india-coal.jpg")
```
]
For next steps, we will be adding the following to the India model:
* Add environmental pollutant emission factors into model
]

# Addressing research question 3

--
.left-column[
How will the water usage for power plant operations change, and how will water constraints affect power plant operations?
]

--
.right-column[
.center[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/parched_power_map.png")
```
]
* Add water intensity factors into model
* Incorportate climate and water/hydrology model outputs as constraints
