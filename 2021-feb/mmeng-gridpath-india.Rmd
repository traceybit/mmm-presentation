# Research questions

1. What are the impacts of technology costs, renewable portfolio standards, and transmission constraints on renewable energy investments?

2. Will the environmental benefits of high renewable penetration be distributed equitably across India? 

3. How will the water usage for power plant operations change, and how will water constraints affect power plant operations?

Transmission capacity will be needed to integrate renewable energy capacity, but limits on transmission buildout could affect which renewable technologies are deployed

# Research questions

1. **What are the impacts of technology costs, renewable portfolio standards, and transmission constraints on renewable energy investments?**

--

  Next steps:
  * Add multiple cost trajectories for wind, solar, and battery storage
  * Build scenarios for renewable portfolio obligation targets of 10%, 30%, 50%, and 70 RE
  * Add transmission constraints

# Cheap coal power plants are co-located with poverty

--
* Coal power plants are concentrated in west-central northern regions of India
<div style= "position: relative; left: 50px; float: left;">
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '52%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/india-grid.jpg")
```
</div>

<div style= "position: relative;">
```{r coal, echo = FALSE, out.width = '27%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/india-coal.jpg")
```
</div>
--

* Largest coal reserves are located in eastern and southern regions, so coal plants there are cheaper to operate
--

* Eastern and southern states also have the highest poverty rates
--

* As solar and wind get cheaper, the more expensive coal plants in higher income regions will likely shut down first

  Next steps:
    * Assign pollutant emission factors (for NOx, SOx, PM2.5, etc) to power plants

# India's power sector is very dependent on water

--

* 80% of India’s electricity is generated from thermal (fossil fuel, biomass, nuclear, and concentrated solar) power plants, which require water for cooling
--

  * Thermal power plants are located in water-stressed areas

    knitr::include_graphics("img/parched_power_map.png")
    ```

--

* Power plants have had to shut down in recent years due to water shortages

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/water-crisis-1.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/water-crisis-2.png")
```

--

* Hydropower plants, which also requires water, make up 10% of electricity generation

  Next steps: 
  * Add water intensity factors into model
  * Incorportate climate and water/hydrology model outputs as constraints
