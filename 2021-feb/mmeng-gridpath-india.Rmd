# Research questions

1. How do renewable energy scenarios India look like given different technology costs, transmission constraints, and renewable portfolio standards (RPS)?

2. Will the environmental benefits of high renewable penetration be distributed equitably across India? 

3. How will the water usage for power plant operations change, and how will water constraints affect power plant operations?

For next steps, we will be adding the following to the India model:
* Multiple cost trajectories for wind, solar, and battery storage
* Transmission constraints
* Renewable portfolio obligations
